# About the class

## Introductions and expectations

## The (_general_) instruction format

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Lecture sessions (Usually Mondays)
- Slide-based delivery of content
- Emphasis on the _why_ of an approach
- The first few might feel tedious and boring
- It will be important that you do the assigned readings or software installation

### Hands-on sessions (Usually Wednesdays)
- No slides, mostly live coding (you follow along)
- Emphasis on _how_ of an approach
- 90% of troubleshooting will ocur during the first sessions
- We will work towards finding a balance of content and time for you to get things done

## Grading
- Lab exercise and attendance: 20%
- Assignments: 30%
- Midterm exam: 10%
- Individual project: 40%

## Lab exercise and attendance (20%)
- These are the Wednesdays hands-on days
- We will be coding side-by-side and you should get these done at the same time as I do
- Basically, 20% of your grade for free

## Assignments (30%)
- There will be 3-4 short assignments
- Designed to gauge whether you are up to speed
- You will submit them via email to me at jc_villasenor@miami.edu

## Exams (10%)
- Midterm exam only
- _Likely_ take-home, date TBD
- A combination of theory (quesitons) and practice (coding problems)

## Final project (40%)
We will design a project where you will apply your newly acquired tools and techniques to your own research or application. As such, individual projects will meet the following criteria:

1. All data and code must be primarily analyzed or processed using R and RStudio
2. The student will show they have mastered the course material by correctly and successfully employing **two tools and techniques covered in part 1 of the course and two tools and techniques covered in part 2 of the course**.
3. The final product will be a 5-7 page report and a 5-7 slide presentation

## Software requirements

- Download and install the latest version of R (currently v 4.4.x)
    - [MacOS](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
    - [Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
- Download and install the latest version of [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

Copy the code below and run it on your session in the server (one line at a time)


```{r, eval = FALSE}
#| code-fold: false
install.packages("sf")
install.packages("terra")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("rnaturalearth")
```

In R, run `installed.packages()`, copy the output, and paste it in an R script called `Lastname_assig1.R` (e.g. `Villasenor_assig1.R`).

In R, run `sessionInfo()` and copy the output to the same R script
